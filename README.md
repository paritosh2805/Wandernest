 We've created a highly optimized application that is easy to navigate and lighting fast to load 
we'll also be leveraging server components to fetch data from the database (Mongodb and 
Prisma) creating seamless user experience.
 Additionally, we've used client components to build out our UI ensuring smooth and 
responsive design.
 With Tailwind CSS, we've created a sleek and modern look for our WanderNest website 
complete with animations and effects that bring the site to life.
 Our design is fully responsive ensuring that it looks great on all the devices from desktop to 
mobile.
 We've implemented credentials authentication (NextAuth) and Google and GitHub 
authentication for a more seamless login process.
